# Data: Your First Embedding

A simple, educational project to demonstrate how to generate and visualize embeddings from textual data using modern embedding models and tools.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository walks you through creating embeddings from a small dataset using pre-trained language models (e.g., OpenAI or Hugging Face transformers), storing them with FAISS for similarity search, and visualizing them using dimensionality reduction techniques like UMAP.

The goal is to help beginners understand the fundamentals of:
- Embedding generation
- Vector similarity
- Visualizing high-dimensional vectors

## ðŸ§  What You'll Learn

- How text data can be transformed into embeddings (dense vector representations)
- How to use tools like Hugging Face, FAISS, and UMAP
- How to search for similar items using vector similarity
- Basic visualization of embedding space

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saranjthilak/data-your-first-embedding.git
cd data-your-first-embedding
pip install -r requirements.txt
